# 🎓 Treasure Vault

Treasure Vault is a powerful knowledge management system designed to capture, organize, and store high-value insights from YouTube videos and manual entries. It helps you turn passive watching into an active library of ideas and actions.

* **One-Click Clipping:** Use the integrated **Chrome Extension** to capture videos directly while browsing YouTube.
* **Manual Entries:** Create "Manual Vaults" for your own thoughts, book notes, or meeting insights.
* **Full CRUD Support:**
* **Create:** Multiple ways to add content (URL, Extension, Manual).
* **Read:** Clean grid view to browse your library and a detailed view for deep reading.
* **Update:** Edit your ideas, titles, or tags at any time.
* **Delete:** Remove vaults you no longer need with a single click.


* **Organized Tags:** Categorize your knowledge using custom tags for easy filtering.

🚀 Roadmap: Upcoming Features
To make Treasure Vault even more powerful, the following features are currently under development:

🔐 **1. Multi-User Authentication (Secure Accounts)**
Personal Vaults: Implementing a secure login system so each user can only see and manage their own private data.

Google OAuth Integration: Allow users to sign in instantly with their Google accounts for a seamless experience.

Encrypted Storage: Enhancing database security to ensure all ideas and transcripts are kept private.

🔍 **2. Advanced Global Search**
Instant Search: A real-time search bar at the top of the dashboard to filter vaults by title or tags as you type.

Full-Text Search: The ability to search inside the transcripts to find specific keywords or "Big Ideas" hidden in your library.

Tag Filtering: A dedicated tag-cloud to quickly view all vaults related to a specific topic (e.g., "Productivity," "Coding," "Finance").

🤖 **3. AI-Powered Insights (Action Points)**
Automated Summarization: Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically summarize 20-minute transcripts into 5 key bullet points.

Smart Action Items: AI will automatically scan the transcript text and extract "Actionable Steps" into the Practical Actions field.
